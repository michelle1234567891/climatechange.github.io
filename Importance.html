<h2> Importance of Addressing The Factors That Cause Climate Change to Remain <h2>
<h3> With the scientific understanding of what GHGs are, what it does to the temperature of the planet, and the effects it creates, it is now necessary to discuss the importance of finding the causes of why society still lacks a solution. The cause of climate change stems from the increase in excess amounts of GHGs in the atmosphere, yet, the reasons as to why we still face this issue are not direct. With the factors determined and held responsible, it appears to be more likely that this climate crisis will begin to be brought down. With the current blur of who is responsible for ending this turmoil, it is unlikely that the public nor other influences will stand up and begin to say what is right. I propose a hypothesis to test if the listed factors of a lack of funding, weak political influence, and a lack of unity of outside powers are the ones that have resulted in where we are today and the inability to solve the issue. <h3>
