<h3> Factor Number One: A Lack of Economic Funding Against Climate Change </h3>
When I refer to funding, I am referring to the money that is necessary in order to successfully transition from fossil fuel derived energy into renewable energy. To investigate this part of the hypothesis, bibliographical and trusted internet research was done to draw a conclusion. Because fossil fuel energy is used for gas to propel transportation, natural gas for heating and cooking, coal to produce electricity, and more, it is intricately woven into daily lives within society. In order to eliminate this constant use of fossil fuels, it is necessary to switch to a renewable energy source that can take its place. According to Cooper Wetherbee, an analyst with the think tank Climate Policy Initiative: it is really the corporate actors and government actors that are making these decisions to finance dirtier or clean energy and infrastructure at scale. Those are the decisions that are most influential in dictating our ability as a society to meet climate targets and maintain the livable, prosperous human society that we want.

The annual global climate funding averaged an unfortunate $632 billion per year over 2019 and 2020, 5 percent of the $4.13 trillion target. There is simply not enough being done to raise money for the cause. This $632 billion came primarily from public sectors, with corporations next in the lead. In ranking from highest to lowest, it then comes from banks, households, funds, and lastly, institutional investors. There is a gap of $3.5 trillion that still needs to be spent every year, in addition to what is being spent now, in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Now the question, where will this come from? In order to reach the goal of $4.13 trillion every year until 2030 to fund an energy transition sufficient to keep the planet below a temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius, more funding needs to be done. So far, society has proven unable to come together and fight the same cause. It is unrealistic to assume that this money will come from one person, or even a dozen.

However, common people are the majority and therefore have the most influence, whether it is known or not. Investing money into a corporation or a fundraiser is one way to go, but so is everyday spending that is done naturally. One study even revealed that if everyone in the US exchanged a quarter of the meat they eat now with plant-based proteins, 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions would be eliminated annually from the agricultural influence on the use of fossil fuels. To take part in the funding, simply be conscious of what you choose to spend your money on, and therefore the likelihood of meeting this goal will increase. This counts as moving your money towards the good of the planet and taking charge of personal responsibility to participate.
