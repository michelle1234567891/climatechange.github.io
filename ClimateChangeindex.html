 <h2> What is Climate Change and Global Warming? </h2>
Climate change is simply the matter of the way that weather patterns change over the course of time. It includes long-term shifts in temperatures and overall patterns that change both by natural occurrences and human activities. While weather is considered short-term atmospheric changes, climate refers to long-term shifts. Since the mid 1700s, during the industrial revolution, human activity has increased in its influence in climate change due to the increase of rising greenhouse gases. This causes a rise in temperatures, ultimately causing an increase in natural disasters such as storms, droughts, and floods and decrease in natural sea ice and glaciers that are necessary. While global warming is a part of climate change, global warming simply refers to the rise in temperatures specifically.

	There is a natural balance in which all life on Earth is dependent on the energy from the sun as well as the energy reflected from the Earth's surface back into the atmosphere. The balance of the energy coming in and going out has been preserved for billions of years, yet, we now run into trouble. Greenhouse gases, also known as GHGs, are the gases in Earth's atmosphere that trap heat. This includes Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous Oxide, Ozone, and many more. Some of which are natural and some are synthetic, however, the problem lies in the amount of these gases that are taking their place in the atmosphere. 
The excess of greenhouse gases are blocking energy from leaving the atmosphere, thus upsetting the balance. Instead of leaving the atmosphere and going into space, this excess energy is being returned to Earth's surface. Therefore, the surface of the Earth heats up, including 
oceans, land, and air. This occurs through the way that Earth naturally absorbs the energy from sunlight and re-emits it as heat, or the scientific term of long-wave infrared radiation. Now, this infrared radiation heads towards space to leave the Earth's atmosphere, passing through oxygen and nitrogen that exist in air. However, say it bumps into a CO2 molecule. This molecule then absorbs that infrared radiation, or heat, and begins to vibrate, emitting it back into the Earth's atmosphere. This is acceptable for small amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere, or any greenhouse gas, but when the levels are uneven and CO2 takes up a majority, the heat cannot enter space and therefore remains in Earth's atmosphere, a constant cycle of heating. This process occurs on repeat and therefore results in the heating of the Earth's temperature overall.
